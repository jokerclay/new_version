# Problem

A Pointer in C++ is used to share a memory address among different contexts (primarily functions).

 They are used whenever a function needs to modify the content of a variable, but it does not have ownership.

In order to access the memory address of a variable, ***val\***, prepend it with ***&\*** sign. 

For example, &val returns the memory address of ***val\***.

This memory address is assigned to a pointer and can be shared among functions. 

For example, ***int\*p = &val\*** assigns the memory address of ***val\*** to pointer ***p***. 

To access the content of the memory pointed to, prepend the variable name with a *. 

For example, *p will return the value stored in ***val\*** and any modification to it will be performed on ***val\***.



```c++
void increment (int *v) {
   (*v)++;
}

int main() {
    int a;
    scanf("%d", &a);
    increment(&a);
    printf("%d", a);
    return 0;
}
```

# Function Description 

Complete the update function in the editor below.

update has the following parameters:

- int*a: an integer
- int*b: an integer



## Returns 

The function is declared with a void return type,so there is no value to return.

 Modify the values in memory so that ***a\*** contains their sum and ***b\*** contains their absoluted difference.

- **a' = a + b**
- **b' = |a - b|** 



## Input Format 

Input will contain two integers, ***a\*** and ***b\***, separated by a newline.

## Sample Input 

```
4
5
```

## Sample Output 

```
9
1
```

## Explanation 

a' = 4 + 5 = 9

b' = | 4 - 5 | = 1

## Solution - Pointer in C++

```c++
#include <stdio.h>

void update(int *a,int *b) {
    // Complete this function 
    int temp = *a;   
    *a = *a + *b;
    *b = temp - *b;
    
    if (*b < 0)
    {
        *b = -(*b);
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, b;
    int *pa = &a, *pb = &b;
    
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    update(pa, pb);
    printf("%d\n%d", a, b);

    return 0;
}
```
